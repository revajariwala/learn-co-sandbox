                <p>A hackathon is a 24-hour event where products and friendships are created.
                   Provided with free food, mentors, and awesome activities, students often work on a
                   personal project to pitch at the end of the hackathon. Overall, hackathons are here to provide
                   a supportive environment for you to learn and explore your interests.</p>
